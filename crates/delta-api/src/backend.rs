//! The `DeltaBackend` port: the narrow backend interface the Delta business logic
//! calls.
//!
//! All Delta *semantics* — the managed-table contract, the `updateTable` action
//! dispatcher, `loadTable` list construction, credential→config mapping, and
//! commit arbitration — live in [`crate::handler`] and are expressed in terms of
//! this trait. A server implements only these operations over its own storage,
//! credential vending, and authorization; it never re-implements any Delta
//! semantics.
//!
//! The trait is generic over a context `Cx` (mangrove's `RequestContext`,
//! lakekeeper's `RequestMetadata`, …) threaded from the axum router. All types
//! exchanged here are the crate's own — the Delta wire DTOs, [`crate::column`],
//! and the coordinate/spec structs below — never a server's resource model.
//!
//! # Authorization contract
//!
//! Authorization goes through **one** hook, [`DeltaBackend::authorize`], which the
//! handler calls with a [`DeltaAction`] before every user-facing operation. The
//! data methods below (`resolve_table`, `create_table_row`, `delete_table`,
//! `vend_*`, `resolve_staging_*`, …) are **pure data access and must not perform
//! their own authorization** — the handler has already authorized the operation.
//! (An implementor is of course free to enforce coarse storage-level guards, but
//! the caller-facing access decision belongs in `authorize`.) See [`crate::authz`].

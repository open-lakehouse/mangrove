//! Async-native, engine-free Delta snapshot construction from a discovered `_delta_log` manifest.
//!
//! [`build_snapshot_from_manifest`] is the list-free / prime-free replacement for the eager
//! `deltalake-wasm` facade path (`PrimedStore::prime` + a synchronous `DataFusionEngine` driven by
//! `InlineExecutor`). The caller discovers the log file set out-of-band (mangrove's `resolve.rs`
//! HEAD-probes it, since plain HTTP has no listing) and hands it here as kernel [`FileMeta`]s; this
//! builds the kernel [`LogSegment`] with **no directory listing** ([`LogSegment::from_listed_files`])
//! and resolves Protocol & Metadata by driving the [`SnapshotPm`] state machine through the
//! engine-free [`DataFusionExecutor`] over the caller's own async object store — the same store the
//! scan path reads through.
//!
//! # Why `async` (not `block_on`)
//!
//! Driving [`SnapshotPm`] reads real files over the object store — commit `.json` (a `Consume`
//! drain) and, for checkpointed tables, the checkpoint parquet footer (a `SchemaQuery`). Those
//! reads `.await` the store. On a browser target the store is `fetch`-backed, and a `fetch`
//! resolves *only* when control returns to the JS event loop. Wrapping the drive in
//! `futures::executor::block_on` parks the (single) worker thread, so the event loop never runs,
//! the fetch never settles, and construction hangs forever. So this builder is genuinely `async`
//! and `.await`s the drive; nothing here blocks. The future is `!Send` (the kernel SM is `!Send`),
//! which is fine on every driver we use — `wasm-bindgen-futures` in the browser, a current-thread
//! runtime in the native tests. Contrast the *scan* path ([`crate::DeltaSsaTableProvider`]), whose
//! SM drive performs no store IO for the tables that reach it and so is still driven with `block_on`
//! (see that type's `scan` for the exact caveat).
